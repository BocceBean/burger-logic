        <h1>JBob's Lunch Logic<sup>*</sup></h1>
        <h3>
          Procuring microwavable cheeseburgers from gas stations on the way to work in the morning, then preparing and eating them for lunch is logically superior to other lunch options.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Microwavable cheeseburgers can be purchased from many gas stations.
            <ul>
              <li>Purchasing food on the way to work eliminates the need to prepare food in advance.</li>
              <li>Multiple outlets for food procurement supports food acquisition even when traffic conditions necessitate route changes.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>Gas station cheeseburgers are usually chilled, grocery store cheeseburgers tend to be frozen. 
            <ul>
              <li>Chilled cheeseburgers take less time to microwave than frozen cheeseburgers.</li>
              <li>Shorter cooking times use less energy to attain optimal serving temperature.</li>
              <li>Gas station cheeseburgers are more energy efficient than the frozen ones sold in  grocery stores.</li>
              <li>Chilled cheeseburgers may be consumed without being heated first in emergencies.</li>
              <li>Gas station cheeseburgers facilitate emergency preparedness better than their frozen counterparts.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
          <li>Microwave cheeseburgers have essentially no flavor.
            <ul>
              <li>Having no flavor means they are very unlikely to taste bad.</li>
              <li><em>(That there is real logic.)</em></li>
            </ul><br />
          <li>Microwave cheeseburgers need ketchup.
            <ul>
              <li>Ketchup tastes good.<sup>**</sup></li>
              <li>Putting ketchup on microwave cheeseburgers makes them taste like ketchup.</li>
              <li>Since ketchup tastes good, putting it on microwave cheeseburgers makes the cheeseburgers taste good.</li>
              <li>Ketchup tastes essentially the same cold as warm.</li>
              <li>If a microwave cheeseburger is prepared with ketchup and gets cold, it still tastes good.<sup>***</sup></li> 
              <br />
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Microwave cheeseburger preparation is an efficient process.
            <ul>
              <li>Microwave cheeseburgers can be cooked in 40-50 seconds.</lI>
              <li><em>(Application of the aforementioned ketchup does add to prep time, but the risk:reward ratio is favorable.</em></li>
              <li>Microwave ovens are often located in close proximity to available, refrigerated cans of Diet Mt. Dew.</li>
              <li>Therefore cheeseburger prep can incorporate beverage procurement with minimal additional overhead.</li>
              <br />
            </ul>
          <li>Microwave cheeseburgers facilitate multitasking and adaptive accommodation.
            <ul>
              <li>Microwave cheeseburgers can be eaten with one hand.</li>
              <li>The free hand (either left or right) is remains available to use for typing, mousing, or other one-handed activities.</li></li>
              <li>No additional adaptation is required to enable eating microwave cheeseburgers using the left hand.</li>
              <br />
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Microwave cheeseburgers can add usable time back to the work day.
            <ul>
              <li>Deciding what to eat can be time consuming, especially if the menu varies from day to day.</li>
              <li>Eating microwave cheeseburgers as a matter of course requires no additional thought.</li>
              <li>Decision-making time that would have been consumed by eating non-microwave cheeseburger foods is automatically reclaimed.</li>
              <li>Reclaimed decision-making time offsets both ketchup application and Diet Mt. Dew procurement times.</li>
              <li>Eating microwave cheeseburgers results in a net positive return of time available for work tasks.</li>
              <br />
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Microwave cheeseburgers require microwaving.
              <ul>
                <li>Having food that requires heating by default mitigates the problem of frozen cheese that can occur in non-microwaved sandwiches.</li>
                <br />
              </ul> 
            </li>
            <br />
          <li>In the time it took you to read this page, you could have nuked your burger and eaten half (or more) of it.</li>
